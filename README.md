# ROOTME
This is the answers to the test I do on the website root-me.org.

https://www.root-me.org/?page=news&lang=fr

It's my personal notes to not forget how I did, as statued here https://www.root-me.org/en/breve/Publishing-solutions-on-Internet I don't do that to leak the informations, if the website ask me to delete this I will, so please don't spoil yourself.

Every informations you need are in the documentation or on the IRC with the community.


As a student I also keep the visibility to all so people (that aren't going to do tests on rootme) can see what I can do and what I learned.
